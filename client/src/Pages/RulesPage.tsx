                        Registrations close on (date). Participants can log in

                        Participants are required to save their code for all
                        submissions, and can be asked to send it at the end of
                        the contest.

                        Once the contest starts, participants must make all
                        submissions from the same device. This is to prevent
                        cheating.

                    <li>
                        Initially you have 200 points, and all questions are
                        locked. You are to unlock questions using these 200
                        points.

                    <li>
                        There is no limit on attempts on a question, but for
                        every wrong submission, you lose points. Penalty depends
                        on the level of difficulty of the question.

                    <li>
                        A correct submission on first attempt on an easy
                        question gives you an attack to use on another player.
                        Similarly for a medium question you get an attack for a
                        correct submission in one of the first 2 attempts, and
                        for a hard question on one of the first 3 attempts.

                    <li>
                        You can select a player to attack from the leaderboard
                        or attacker's list.
